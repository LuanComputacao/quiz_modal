# Clean Slate HTML

## What is it?

**Clean Slate is a basic starter HTML file** that provides a small number of essential tags for web projects. It's intentionally light and includes only what happens inside the HTML file.

Clean Slate's goal is to start development without having to rip out any unnecessary markup.
